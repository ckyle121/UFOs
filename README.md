## Overview of the Project
For many years, humans have wondered "Is other life out there?" Cases of reported UFO sightings all over the world have been complied in order for those interested in the possiblity of extraterrestrial life to sort through. Client, Dana, is doing an interactive article about her hometown McMinnville, Oregon, which hosts the UFO festival every year. In this project, we use the knowlege of javascript to create an html page for Dana's webpage visitors to serach for various articles about UFO sightings by country, city, state, and even type of UFO shape. 
## Results 
Below shows what appears when a user first visits the webpage.

We created a webpage for users to search through thousands of articles of UFO sightings. Hundred of articles have been created from UFO sightings, and users are able to search for different sightings by date, country, city, state, and shape of UFO. Once someone comes to the webpage, they see the article by Dana at the top, followed by a long list of UFO reported sightings. Users then can use the filters to edit the results to display the articles that match their search critera.
